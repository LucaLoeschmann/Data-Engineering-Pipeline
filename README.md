# Data-Engineering-Pipeline

As part of my Data Science Bootcamp at the WBS Coding School I was wcreating an automated, cloud-based pipeline.

## Objective

Gans is a fictional startup developing an e-scooter-sharing system, and Iâ€™ve been hired as their Junior Data Engineer. My task as their Data Engineer is to collect data about the weather and flights for five major German cities to help Gans predict e-scooter movement.
The goal is to create an automated, cloud-based data pipeline that continuously collects and updates weather and flight data.
