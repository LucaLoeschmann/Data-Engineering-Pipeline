# Data-Engineering-Pipeline

As part of my Data Science Bootcamp at the WBS Coding School I was creating an automated, cloud-based pipeline.

## Objective

Gans is a fictional startup developing an e-scooter-sharing system. Iâ€™ve been hired as their Junior Data Engineer. My task as their Data Engineer is to collect data about the weather and flights for five major German cities to help Gans predict e-scooter movement.
The goal is to create an automated, cloud-based data pipeline that continuously collects and updates weather and flight data. 

## Individual Steps
- Webscraping Wikipedia articles to extract information about the cities
- Using APIs for the weather (OpenWeather) and flight (AeroDataBox) data
- Creating a database on my MySQL
- Building a local pipeline: Pushing data from my Jupyter notebooks onto MySQL
- Using Google Cloud to deploy an automated pipeline

## Deliverables 

An article on Medium following my journey through this project can be found [here](https://medium.com/@luca.loeschmann/building-a-cloud-based-data-pipeline-my-data-engineering-story-c4b1b6ac4346).

Above are my individual notebooks that were used to create the local pipeline.
